  # Find the missing ðŸ«‚

</div>

**Our vision is for every missing child and adult, and every loved one left behind, to find help, hope and a safe way to reconnect.**
  
# Features
* Seperate Authentication System for Police Administration and User.

* Once logged in, Police can upload the details and photos of missing victims. 

* For User, whenever they find a lost person, he/she can upload their photos and out System will check if there is any victim who matches with that person.

* For matching faces, we are using ML Rekognition which provided efficient and quick results.

* If a suspect and victim matches, we'll inform the police through email and notification.

> This Project is a submission for Microsoft Engage 2022.
